The real aircraft
=================
NC 18609 was a 314A, flown by Panam from 1941 to 1946, as Pacific Clipper.

The rudder has 3 fins, because the tests had not enough directional control with only 1 or 2.

The turret over the middle of the wing is for star navigation.
The windows just fowards the wing is the spacious flightdeck (navigator, radio and engineer), closed from the cockpit by
a curtain during night flights (night vision). Doors at the rear of the flightdeck, enabled to go inside the wings during
the flight.

The price of a ticket was like the Concorde today.

The flag on the bow, the top of the wing, and below the sponsons was to identify itself as neutral aircraft (war time) (A).


Model
=====
The following proportions are respected :
- overall length, width, height and propeller diameter (14.5 ft).
- in length : cockpit windows 1/7 , wing 2/7 to 4/7, horizontal stabilizer 6/7.
- in height : middle rudder fin 11/27.
- in propeller diameter : engine 1/3.

For the transparency, propeller discs must be the last of the file (all other objects belong to a fuselage group at the
export).

This model can also be used as 314 (same dimensions).


TO DO
=====
- grooves (sponsons, top of fuselage).
- logo on the rudders.
- a reversed "PAA" logo for the bow right (italic in direction of the speed).


Known problems
==============
Panam livery :
- the wing color was somewhere between yellow and red.
- the fuselage seemed to be a metallic grey blue.
- the yellow strips behind the engines seem to be not systematic.
- in absence of photography of NC 18609, the flag is only on the bow.

Geometry:
- the top of the rudder fins is slightly too long.
