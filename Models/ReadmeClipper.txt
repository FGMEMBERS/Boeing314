The real aircraft
=================
NC 18609 was a 314A, flown by Panam from 1941 to 1946, as Pacific Clipper (A).

The rudder has 3 fins, because the tests had not enough directional control with only 1 or 2.

The turret over the middle of the wing is for star navigation.
The windows just fowards the wing is the spacious flightdeck (navigator, radio and engineer), closed from the cockpit by
a curtain during night flights (night vision). Doors at the rear of the flightdeck, enabled to go inside the wings during
the flight.

The price of a ticket was like the Concorde today.

The flag on the bow, the top of the wing, and below the sponsons was to identify itself as neutral aircraft (war time) (B).

C-98 is the military designation of the 314 (C)(D).


Model
=====
The following proportions are respected :
- overall length, width, height and propeller diameter (14.5 ft).
- in length : cockpit windows 1/7 , wing 2/7 to 4/7, horizontal stabilizer 6/7.
- in height : middle rudder fin 11/27.
- in propeller diameter : engine 1/3.
- panel height = 1/2 of height to floor (below the panel).

This model can also be used as 314 (same dimensions).


For the transparency, propeller discs must be the last of the file :
- all other objects belong to a fuselage group, at the export.
- outboard discs are inside a group, whose parent is the last but one object.
- inboard discs are inside a group, whose parent is the last object.


Texturing
---------
The yellow strips are delimited by the mesh (except the rounded tip) :
- map the right texture on the right wing.
- mirror to the left wing, and map the registration below it.


TO DO
=====
- dilate the model (scale is underestimated).
- shape of hull behind the step (afterbody).
- grooves (sponsons, top of fuselage).
- a reversed "PAA" logo for the bow right (italic in direction of the speed).
- door accessing the "star room" from the flight deck.
- replace material by texture.


Known problems
==============
- the top of the vertical stabilizers is slightly too long.

Known problems Panam livery
---------------------------
- since the livery is not a skin, it would be difficult to repaint it.
- the wing color was somewhere between yellow and red.
- the fuselage seemed to be a metallic grey blue.
- the yellow strips behind the engines seem to be not systematic.
- in absence of photography of NC 18609, the flag is only on the bow.
- the Boeing logo seems to be green.
